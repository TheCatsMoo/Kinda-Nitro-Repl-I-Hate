Check your DMs from TheCatsMoo

There you will find a token for your bot!

Click the lock icon on the side of the replit page. 

In the box that says `key` type ``TOKEN``

In the box that says `value` paste the token you got from TheCatsMoo

Click `Add new secret`

Click the button that says `run` at the top of the page. The bot might take anywhere to a min to boot up. 

** If the run button goes back to `run` after you clicked it, click the packages icon and type in `nextcord` and click the `+` next to the name.**
